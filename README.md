<h1>This repo is all about practicing Stream API skills</h1>
<hr>

<strong><em>What you can expect:</em></strong>
1. Practical exercises ranging from easy to hard (Exercise files are quite simple, other ones with classes might be confusing)
2. The understanding of the overall structure of the Stream APIs. You can couple them with online tutorials and connect the dots if you encounter sth you do not get.
3. As a bonus, there is a class named Morgan Stanley where I included one of their interview questions. Check it out!
